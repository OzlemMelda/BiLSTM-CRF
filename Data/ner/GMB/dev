A O

In O
early B-TIM
2008 I-TIM
the O

The O

A O

The O

an O

a O

how O

It O
also O
says O
U.S. B-GEO

still O
knows O
" O

the O

Some O

The O

some O

Prior O

a O

tourism O

a O
boom O
in O

drop O

The O

2009 B-TIM
took O
a O

contraction O

a O

The O

, O
when O

account O
for O
about O
36 O

However O
, O
the O
financial O
sector O
currently O
is O
smaller O
than O
it O
has O
been O
in O
the O
past O
because O
of O
the O
enactment O
of O
new O
and O
stricter O
financial O
regulations O
in O
2000 B-TIM
that O
caused O
many O
international O
businesses O

Manufacturing O
and O
agriculture O
combined O
contribute O
approximately O
a O
tenth O
of O

show O
little O
growth O
, O
despite O
government O
incentives O
aimed O
at O
those O

Overall O

A O

vaccinating O

prevent O

The O
finding O

The O

concludes O
that O
vaccination O
can O
be O
an O
attractive O
tool O

in O

The O
study O

it O
takes O
about O
two O

Scientists O

the O

200 O

The O
report O
said O
Anbar B-GEO

slowly O

In O

50 O

type O
1 O
diabetes O

That O
sort O
of O

also O
called O
juvenile O
diabetes O
because O
it O
is O
often O
diagnosed O
in O
childhood O
or O
early O
adulthood O
. O

Researchers O
say O
the O
ability O
to O
forecast O
a O
vulnerability O
to O
diabetes O
would O
allow O
doctors O
to O
intervene O
in O
time O
to O
lessen O
its O
impact O
on O
patients O
. O

Type O
1 O
diabetes O
is O
an O

the O

its O
cells O

produce O
insulin O

a O
