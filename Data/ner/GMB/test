Under O
Mr. B-PER
Olmert I-PER

plan O

about O
70,000 O
Jewish O

be O
removed O

At O

Israel B-GEO

Mr. B-PER
Olmert I-PER

he O
would O
prefer O
to O
do O
this O
as O
part O
of O
an O
agreement O
with O
the O
Palestinians B-GPE

But O
he O
believes O
that O
is O
impossible O
because O
the O
Islamic B-ORG
militant I-ORG
group I-ORG
Hamas I-ORG
, O
which O
seeks O
Israel B-GEO

destruction O
, O
now O
heads O

Mr. B-PER
Olmert I-PER
says O
if O
there O
is O
no O
Palestinian B-GPE
peace O
partner O
, O
Israel B-GEO
will O
withdraw O
unilaterally O
. O

" O
We O
will O
have O
to O
act O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
a O
broad O
national O
consensus O
in O
Israel B-GEO
and O
work O
towards O
fixing O

the O
permanent O

" O

Former O
Palestinian B-GPE
legislator O
Sabri B-PER
Saddam I-PER
says O
expanding O
settlements O
and O
annexing O
land O
will O
only O
bring O
more O
conflict O
. O

" O
The O
unilateral O
withdrawal O
is O
not O
a O
solution O
at O
all O
but O
rather O
a O
false O
disengagement O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
What O
we O
're O
looking O
for O
is O
a O
final O
, O
just O

fair O
peace O

" O

In O
addition O
to O
Palestinian B-GPE
opposition O
, O
Mr. B-PER
Olmert I-PER
faces O
another O
obstacle O
to O
implementing O
the O
pullout O
plan O

His O
coalition O
with O
Labor B-ORG
does O
not O
give O
him O
a O
majority O
in O
the O
120-member O
Knesset O
or O
parliament O

Therefore O
, O
he O
will O
have O
to O
bring O
the O
ultra-Orthodox O
Shas O
party O
into O
the O
coalition O
, O
and O
Shas B-ORG
opposes O

An O

Mr. B-PER

which O

The O

The O

a O

authorizing O
the O

A O
Chinese B-GPE
foreign O

official O
says O
linking O

Friday B-TIM

the O

a O

the O

predicts O

that O
